/**
 * Release distribution contract for z3store.
 *
 * This module is the single source for release target mapping and every
 * published file name. Build scripts, workflows, install docs, and packaging
 * drafts derive names from here; none of them restate these strings.
 *
 * Contract rules:
 *   - Exported names and the shapes of exported values are frozen once a
 *     release has been published, because mise asset autodetection, packslip
 *     manifests and Homebrew formulae key on them.
 *   - Exactly two fields may change when the Rust migration lands:
 *     `BUILD_ADAPTER` and `VERSION_SOURCE`. Asset names, archive layout, the
 *     checksum file, the workflow path and the signer identity stay fixed.
 *   - The version comes from `VERSION_SOURCE` only (`build.zig.zon` today).
